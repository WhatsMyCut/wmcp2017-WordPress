= FORM BUILDER =
POWr Form Builder has changed the way we make forms. Create anything - contact forms, registrations, surveys, sign ups, order forms, mailing lists, subscriptions, and more - all right inside the intuitive POWr Editor. There’s no code to learn, and no complicated setup. POWr Forms are 100% mobile-responsive and work in any Wordpress template or theme. Join the 500,000 people already saving time, money, and effort with POWr Form Builder.

Accept Payments
POWr Form Builder lets you easily accept secure payments through PayPal or credit card. Create custom payment forms, order forms, billing templates, sales agreements, and collection letters, then add them to any website or send directly with a link. Or create a donation form and collect donations for a nonprofit or charity. You can even charge customers for memberships and service agreements with recurring subscriptions, including trial periods, setup charges, and discount codes. Tack on shipping and tax charges, and you’re ready to start selling anything online with this simple eCommerce order form.

Smarter Forms
Powerful conditional logic lets you create smart forms quickly and easily. Add a conditional statement to a form field, and choose which conditions will display that field. Just like an “if then” statement, you can set specific choices on specific form fields to trigger other fields later in your form. Smart forms save your visitors time, increase conversions, and help you optimize website design by conserving space. It’s your own personal “if this then that” (IFTTT) generator.

Advanced Behavior
What happens after someone submits your form? With POWr Form Builder, you decide. Receive an automatic email alert in your inbox. Choose to lock or hide the form, reset the form to blank and allow another submission, or redirect your visitor to another page where they can complete a payment, write a review, or continue browsing. Making a poll? Consider showing statistics from previous submissions. Or display a friendly success message. You can even set up automatic confirmation emails sent to your visitor or customer, with customizable sender, subject line and email content. Building trust and confidence with your visitors has never been easier.


= SOCIAL FEED =
POWr Social Feed is a whole new way to leverage social media on Wordpress. Get more conversions, encourage return visits, and increase time spent on your site. With a few clicks, you can connect any social media account or channel to your social feed, and display posts right on your website. Combine images, videos and articles in a single responsive gallery. Then, set the priority of each feed to balance your content mix.

Any Platform
POWr Social Feed supports every major social media platform, so you can drive traffic to all you social media accounts. Connect Facebook business, celebrity, and event pages; Instagram @handles and #hashtags; Pinterest boards; YouTube users, channels, and playlists; Twitter @handles and #hashtags; Vine @handles and #hashtags; Tumblr blogs; Flickr users; Vimeo users and channels; Dailymotion users; and RSS feeds. No matter what social media networks you use, Social Feed helps you get more Likes, Shares, and Followers quickly and easily.

Automatic Updates
Keep your website fresh and engaging without spending time or money. POWr Social Feed automatically pulls in posts from all your social accounts, posts them to your website or store, and automatically arranges them in a beautiful gallery. Blazing fast update times keep your visitors up to date with all your social activity. Let Social Feed update your site and capture new followers automatically, while you focus on running your blog or business.

Manual Approvals
Easy to use moderation controls let you hand pick which posts to display, and which to hide. Fine tune your content mix to engage your target audience, and maximize your social media shares and follows. Choose to automatically display new posts, then remove individual posts manually. Or hide all posts automatically and manually enable only the posts you want to display.


= POPUP =
POWr Popup lets you add a custom popup message to any page. Promote sales, highlight products, or build your mailing list. Stop worrying about optimizing the top of your funnel, and let a beautiful popup do the work for you. Convert one-time visitors into lifelong readers or customers. Drive more sales by letting shoppers know about special offers and new releases at exactly the right moment. You can even grow your social media following with embedded links, videos, and content.

Custom Forms
Most popups let you collect a name and email address. But only POWr Popup lets you embed the legendary POWr Form Builder inside a custom popup message. Collect the exact visitor information you need, with customizable form fields, conditional logic, and even built in payment options. POWr Popup lets you leverage the deep functionality of custom forms at exactly the right time. Whether you’re building an email list or signing up visitors for a free trial, this popup lets you automate and simplify your marketing funnel.

Time Controls
Catch visitors at the perfect moment to increase your conversions. POWr Popup can be triggered on a time delay, a visitor’s click, or right before a visitor leaves your page. Cut your abandonment rates by 50%, without ever lifting a finger, and increase visitor time on your site. POWr Popup knows when someone is about to exit your page, and gives you the opportunity to present a special deal, offer, or promotional code, or even a quick email sign-up. So you can keep visitors engaged, or reach out to them later.

Rich Media
Don’t limit yourself with static content and boring text blocks. Grab attention and keep visitors interested with rich media like photos, videos, and even responsive social galleries. Welcome visitors to your site or store with a popup intro video. Or push them to follow your social media accounts with a set of linking social media icons. Even add a miniature online store, to help visitors find your best deals without ever having to search. POWr Popup is a blank canvas that lets you decided what, where, and when to engage your visitors.
